Things that need to be done, listed in no particular order.

- Python 3 support (should be easy enough)
- Proper error handling (Raise exceptions for each error case)
- Documentation (do this for version 1.0)
- Support more SOCKS versions
- Support authentication methods (at least GSSAPI and username / password)
- Support other types of commands (not just connect)
- Implement a test suite
